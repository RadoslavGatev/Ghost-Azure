Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, `like this`. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:\\n\\n```\\n.my-link {\\n    text-decoration: underline;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIf you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using [Prism.js](http:\/\/prismjs.com\/).\\n\\n\\n## Full bleed images\\n\\nOne neat trick which you can use in Markdown to distinguish between different types of images is to add a `#hash` value to the end of the source URL, and then target images containing the hash with special styling. For example:\\n\\n![walking](https:\/\/casper.ghost.org\/v1.0.0\/images\/walking.jpg#full)\\n\\nwhich is styled with...\\n\\n```\\nimg[src$=\\\"#full\\\"] {\\n    max-width: 100vw;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis creates full-bleed images in the Casper theme, which stretch beyond their usual boundaries right up to the edge of the window. Every theme handles these types of things slightly differently, but it's a great trick to play with if you want to have a variety of image sizes and styles.\\n\\n\\n## Reference lists\\n\\n**The quick brown [fox][1], jumped over the lazy [dog][2].**\\n\\n[1]: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fox \\\"Wikipedia: Fox\\\"\\n[2]: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dog \\\"Wikipedia: Dog\\\"\\n\\nAnother way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.\\n\\n\\n## Creating footnotes\\n\\nThe quick brown fox[^1] jumped over the lazy dog[^2].\\n\\n[^1]: Foxes are red\\n[^2]: Dogs are usually not red\\n\\nFootnotes are a great way to add additional contextual details when appropriate. Ghost will automatically add footnote content to the very end of your post.\\n\\n\\n## Full HTML\\n\\nPerhaps the best part of Markdown is that you're never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Ghost editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here's a standard YouTube embed code as an example:\\n\\n<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Cniqsc9QfDo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}",

You can think of Ghost tags a lot like Gmail labels. By tagging posts with one or more keyword, you can organise articles into buckets of related content.\\n\\n\\n## Basic tagging\\n\\nWhen you write a post, you can assign tags to help differentiate between categories of content. For example, you might tag some posts with `News` and other posts with `Cycling`, which would create two distinct categories of content listed on `/tag/news/` and `/tag/cycling/`, respectively.\\n\\nIf you tag a post with both `News` *and* `Cycling` - then it appears in both sections.\\n\\nTag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you have. They have their own pages, their own RSS feeds, and can support their own cover images and meta data.\\n\\n\\n## The primary tag\\n\\nInside the Ghost editor, you can drag and drop tags into a specific order. The first tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will only display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default. So you can add the most important tag which you want to show up in your theme, but also add a bunch of related tags which are less important.\\n\\n==**News**, Cycling, Bart Stevens, Extreme Sports==\\n\\nIn this example, **News** is the primary tag which will be displayed by the theme, but the post will also still receive all the other tags, and show up in their respective archives.\\n\\n\\n## Private tags\\n\\nSometimes you may want to assign a post a specific tag, but you don't necessarily want that tag appearing in the theme or creating an archive page. In Ghost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.\\n\\nFor example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want your theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more space for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could use private tags to tell your theme what to do.\\n\\n==**News**, Cycling, #video==\\n\\nHere, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of `News`, and `Cycling` - but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with `#video`.\\n\\nIn your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them special formatting:\\n\\n```\\n{{#post}}\\n    {{#has tag=\\\"#video\\\"}}\\n        ...markup for a nice big video post layout...\\n    {{else}}\\n        ...regular markup for a post...\\n    {{/has}}\\n{{/post}}\\n```\\n\\nYou can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many more over on Ghost's extensive [theme documentation](https://themes.ghost.org/).\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}",

The biggest benefit of Markdown is that you can quickly apply formatting as you type, without needing to pause.\\n\\nAt the bottom of the editor, you'll find a toolbar with basic formatting options to help you get started as easily as possible. You'll also notice that there's a **?** icon, which contains more advanced shortcuts.\\n\\nFor now, though, let's run you through some of the basics. You'll want to make sure you're editing this post in order to see all the Markdown we've used.\\n\\n\\n## Formatting text\\n\\nThe most common shortcuts are of course, **bold** text, _italic_ text, and [hyperlinks](https://example.com). These generally make up the bulk of any document. You can type the characters out, but you can also use keyboard shortcuts.\\n\\n* `CMD/Ctrl + B` for Bold\\n* `CMD/Ctrl + I` for Italic\\n* `CMD/Ctrl + K` for a Link\\n* `CMD/Ctrl + H` for a Heading (Press multiple times for h2/h3/h4/etc)\\n\\nWith just a couple of extra characters here and there, you're well on your way to creating a beautifully formatted story.\\n\\n\\n## Inserting images\\n\\nImages in Markdown look just the same as links, except they're prefixed with an exclamation mark, like this:\\n\\n`![Image description](/path/to/image.jpg)`\\n\\n![Computer](https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/computer.jpg)\\n\\nMost Markdown editors don't make you type this out, though. In Ghost you can click on the image icon in the toolbar at the bottom of the editor, or you can just click and drag an image from your desktop directly into the editor. Both will upload the image for you and generate the appropriate Markdown.\\n\\n_**Important Note:** Ghost does not currently have automatic image resizing, so it's always a good idea to make sure your images aren't gigantic files **before** uploading them to Ghost._\\n\\n\\n## Making lists\\n\\nLists in HTML are a formatting nightmare, but in Markdown they become an absolute breeze with just a couple of characters and a bit of smart automation. For numbered lists, just write out the numbers. For bullet lists, just use `*` or `-` or `+`. Like this:\\n\\n1. Crack the eggs over a bowl\\n2. Whisk them together\\n3. Make an omelette\\n\\nor\\n\\n- Remember to buy milk\\n- Feed the cat\\n- Come up with idea for next story\\n\\n\\n## Adding quotes\\n\\nWhen you want to pull out a particularly good excerpt in the middle of a piece, you can use `>` at the beginning of a paragraph to turn it into a Blockquote. You might've seen this formatting before in email clients.\\n\\n> A well placed quote guides a reader through a story, helping them to understand the most important points being made\\n\\nAll themes handles blockquotes slightly differently. Sometimes they'll look better kept shorter, while other times you can quote fairly hefty amounts of text and get away with it. Generally, the safest option is to use blockquotes sparingly.\\n\\n\\n## Dividing things up\\n\\nIf you're writing a piece in parts and you just feel like you need to divide a couple of sections distinctly from each other, a horizontal rule might be just what you need. Dropping `---` on a new line will create a sleek divider, anywhere you want it.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis should get you going with the vast majority of what you need to do in the editor, but if you're still curious about more advanced tips then check out the [Advanced Markdown Guide](/advanced-markdown/) - or if you'd rather learn about how Ghost taxononomies work, we've got a overview of [how to use Ghost tags](/using-tags/).\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}",
