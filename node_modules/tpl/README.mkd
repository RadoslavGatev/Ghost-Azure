# tpl
a general purpose template cli

## Installation

`npm install tpl` or `npm install -g tpl`

## Usage

### Simple

To parse a file and apply a template, simply provide the file as an argument.

``` bash
tpl hello-world.mkd
```

This will do several things.

1.  Look for a `.tpl` directory in the current working directory, if none exists
    look for one in the parent directory, in the parent's parent directory and
    so on. If there's no `.tpl` directory all the way up to the root, use the
    default `.tpl` in the installation directory.
2.  Use the configuration defined in `./tpl/conf.json`.
3.  Look for a parser for the file extension (`.mkd`). If none was found,
    use the default parser.
4.  Read and parse the file.
5.  Look if the file defined a template, which should be used for its rendering.
    If not, use the default rendering.
6.  Print the rendered document.

If you want to save the output, you can use

``` bash
tpl hello-world.mkd > hello-world.html
```

### Use custom configuration
