# Changelog

## Version 0.6.0

* Give priority to more common attribute values (Previously the first matching simple selector was taken instead);
* Repeated simple selectors should not affect the tree balance and should not produce extra tree nodes (But they affect the specificity).

## Version 0.5.0
