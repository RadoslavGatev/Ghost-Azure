{{alias}}( value )
    Tests if a value is an email address.

    Validation is not rigorous. *9* RFCs relate to email addresses, and
    accounting for all of them is a fool's errand. The function performs the
    simplest validation; i.e., requiring at least one `@` symbol.

    For rigorous validation, send a confirmation email. If the email bounces,
    consider the email invalid.

    Parameters
    ----------
    value: any
        Value to test.

    Returns
    -------
    bool: boolean
        Boolean indicating whether value is an email address.

    Examples
    --------
    > var bool = {{alias}}( 'beep@boop.com' )
    true
    > bool = {{alias}}( 'beep' )
    false
    > bool = {{alias}}( null )
    false
