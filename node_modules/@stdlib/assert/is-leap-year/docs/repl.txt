{{alias}}( value )
    Tests whether a value corresponds to a leap year in the Gregorian calendar.

    A leap year is defined as any year which is exactly divisible by 4, except
    for years which are exactly divisible by 100 and not by 400. In this
    definition, 100 corresponds to years marking a new century, and 400
    corresponds to the length of the *leap cycle*.

    If not provided any arguments, the function returns a boolean indicating
    if the current year (according to local time) is a leap year.

    Parameters
    ----------
    value: any
        Value to test.

    Returns
    -------
    bool: boolean
        Boolean indicating whether value corresponds to a leap year.

    Examples
    --------
    > var bool = {{alias}}( new Date() )
    <boolean>
    > bool = {{alias}}( 1996 )
    true
    > bool = {{alias}}( 2001 )
    false
