{{alias}}( value )
    Tests if a value is a RangeError object.

    This function should *not* be considered robust. While the function should
    always return `true` if provided a RangeError (or a descendant) object,
    false positives may occur due to the fact that the RangeError constructor
    inherits from Error and has no internal class of its own. Hence, RangeError
    impersonation is possible.

    Parameters
    ----------
    value: any
        Value to test.

    Returns
    -------
    bool: boolean
        Boolean indicating whether value is a RangeError object.

    Examples
    --------
    > var bool = {{alias}}( new RangeError( 'beep' ) )
    true
    > bool = {{alias}}( {} )
    false
