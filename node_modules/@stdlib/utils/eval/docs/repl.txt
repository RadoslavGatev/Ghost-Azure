{{alias}}( str )
    Alias for `eval` global.

    A reference to `eval` is treated differently by the compiler. For example,
    when evaluating code containing block-scoped declarations  (e.g., `let`,
    `const`, `function`, `class`), the compiler may throw an `error` complaining
    that block-scoped declarations are not yet supported outside of
    `strict mode`. One possible workaround is to include `"use strict";` in the
    evaluated code.

    Parameters
    ----------
    str: string
        Code to evaluate.

    Returns
    -------
    out: any
        Returned value if applicable.

    Examples
    --------
    > var v = {{alias}}( '5*4*3*2*1' )
    120
