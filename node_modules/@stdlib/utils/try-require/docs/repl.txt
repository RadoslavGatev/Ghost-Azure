{{alias}}( id )
    Wraps `require` in a `try/catch` block.

    This function traps and returns any errors encountered when attempting to
    require a module.

    Use caution when attempting to resolve a relative path or a local module.
    This function attempts to resolve a module from its current path. Thus, the
    function is unable to resolve anything which is not along its search path.
    For local requires, use an absolute file path.

    Parameters
    ----------
    id: string
        Module id.

    Returns
    -------
    out: any|Error
        Resolved module or an `Error`.

    Examples
    --------
    > var out = {{alias}}( '_unknown_module_id_' )
    <Error>
