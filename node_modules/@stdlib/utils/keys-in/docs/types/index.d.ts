/**
* Returns an array of an object's own and inherited enumerable property names.
*
* ## Notes
*
* -   Name order is not guaranteed, as object key enumeration is not specified according to the ECMAScript specification. In practice, however, most engines use insertion order to sort an object's keys, thus allowing for deterministic extraction.
*
* @param obj - input value
* @returns key array
*
* @example
* function Foo() {
*     this.beep = 'boop';
*     return this;
* }
*
* Foo.prototype.foo = 'bar';
*
* var obj = new Foo();
*
* var keys = keysIn( obj );
* // e.g., returns [ 'beep', 'foo' ]
*/
declare function keysIn( obj: any ): Array<string>;
