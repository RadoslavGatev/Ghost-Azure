{{alias}}()
    First-in-first-out (FIFO) queue constructor.

    Returns
    -------
    queue: Object
        First-in-first-out queue.

    queue.clear: Function
        Clears the queue.

    queue.first: Function
        Returns the "oldest" queue value (i.e., the value which is "first-out").
        If the queue is empty, the returned value is `undefined`.

    queue.iterator: Function
        Returns an iterator for iterating over a queue. If an environment
        supports Symbol.iterator, the returned iterator is iterable. Note that,
        in order to prevent confusion arising from queue mutation during
        iteration, a returned iterator **always** iterates over a queue
        "snapshot", which is defined as the list of queue elements at the time
        of the method's invocation.

    queue.last: Function
        Returns the "newest" queue value (i.e., the value which is "last-out").
        If the queue is empty, the returned value is `undefined`.

    queue.length: integer
        Queue length.

    queue.pop: Function
        Removes and returns the current "first-out" value from the queue. If the
        queue is empty, the returned value is `undefined`.

    queue.push: Function
        Adds a value to the queue.

    queue.toArray: Function
        Returns an array of queue values.

    queue.toJSON: Function
        Serializes a queue as JSON.

    Examples
    --------
    > var q = {{alias}}();
    > q.push( 'foo' ).push( 'bar' );
    > q.length
    2
    > q.pop()
    'foo'
    > q.length
    1
    > q.pop()
    'bar'
    > q.length
    0
