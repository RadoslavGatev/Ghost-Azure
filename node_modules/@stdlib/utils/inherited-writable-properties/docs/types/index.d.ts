/**
* Returns an array of an object's inherited writable property names and symbols.
*
* ## Notes
*
* -   Property order is not guaranteed, as object property enumeration is not specified according to the ECMAScript specification. In practice, however, most engines use insertion order to sort an object's properties, thus allowing for deterministic extraction.
* -   If provided `null` or `undefined`, the function returns an empty array.
*
* @param value - input object
* @param level - inheritance level
* @throws second argument must be a positive integer
* @returns a list of inherited writable property names and symbols
*
* @example
* var props = inheritedWritableProperties( {} );
