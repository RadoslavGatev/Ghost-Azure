{{alias}}( source, prop, target )
    Moves a property from one object to another object.

    The property is deleted from the source object and the property's descriptor
    is preserved during transfer.

    If a source property is not configurable, the function throws an error, as
    the property cannot be deleted from the source object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    source: Object
        Source object.

    prop: string
        Property to move.

    target: Object
        Target object.

    Returns
    -------
    bool: boolean
        Boolean indicating whether operation was successful.

    Examples
    --------
    > var obj1 = { 'a': 'b' };
    > var obj2 = {};
    > var bool = {{alias}}( obj1, 'a', obj2 )
    true
    > bool = {{alias}}( obj1, 'c', obj2 )
    false
