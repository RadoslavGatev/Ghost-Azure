{{alias}}( [value] )
    Returns the number of days in a year according to the Gregorian calendar.

    By default, the function returns the number of days in the current year
    (according to local time). To determine the number of days for a particular
    year, provide either a year or a `Date` object.

    The function's return value is a generalization and does **not** take into
    account inaccuracies due to daylight savings conventions, crossing
    timezones, or other complications with time and dates.

    out: integer
        Number of days in a year.
