# toc

> Return a high-resolution time difference.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var toc = require( '@stdlib/time/toc' );
```

#### toc( time )

Returns a high-resolution time difference, where `time` is a two-element `array` with format `[seconds, nanoseconds]`.

```javascript
var delta = toc( [ 100, 123456789 ] );
// returns [<number>,<number>]
```

Similar to `time`, the returned `array` has format `[seconds, nanoseconds]`.
