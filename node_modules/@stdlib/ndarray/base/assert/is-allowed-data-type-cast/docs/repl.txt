{{alias}}( from, to, casting )
    Returns a boolean indicating whether a provided ndarray data type can be
    cast to another ndarray data type according to a specified casting mode.

    The following casting modes are supported:

    - 'none': only allow casting between identical types
    - 'equiv': allow casting between identical and byte swapped types
    - 'safe': only allow "safe" casts
    - 'same-kind': allow "safe" casts and casts within the same kind (e.g.,
    between signed integers or between floats)
    - 'unsafe': allow casting between all types (including between integers and
    floats)

    Parameters
    ----------
    from: string
        ndarray data type.

    to: string
        ndarray data type.

    casting: string
        ndarray casting mode.

    Returns
    -------
    bool: boolean
        Boolean indicating whether a data type can be cast to another data type.

    Examples
    --------
    > var bool = {{alias}}( 'float32', 'float64', 'safe' )
    true
    > bool = {{alias}}( 'float64', 'int32', 'safe' )
    false
