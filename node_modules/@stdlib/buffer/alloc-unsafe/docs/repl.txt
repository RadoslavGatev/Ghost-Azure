{{alias}}( size )
    Allocates a buffer having a specified number of bytes.

    The underlying memory of returned buffers is not initialized. Memory
    contents are unknown and may contain sensitive data.

    When the size is less than half a buffer pool size, memory is allocated from
    the buffer pool for faster allocation of Buffer instances.

    Parameters
    ----------
    size: integer
        Number of bytes to allocate.

    Returns
    -------
    out: Buffer
        Buffer instance.

    Examples
    --------
    > var buf = {{alias}}( 100 )
    <Buffer>
