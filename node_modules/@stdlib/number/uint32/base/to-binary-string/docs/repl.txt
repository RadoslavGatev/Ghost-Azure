{{alias}}( x )
    Returns a string giving the literal bit representation of an unsigned 32-bit
    integer.

    Except for typed arrays, JavaScript does not provide native user support for
    unsigned 32-bit integers. According to the ECMAScript standard, `number`
    values correspond to double-precision floating-point numbers. While this
    function is intended for unsigned 32-bit integers, the function will accept
    floating-point values and represent the values as if they are unsigned
    32-bit integers. Accordingly, care should be taken to ensure that only
    nonnegative integer values less than `4,294,967,296` (`2^32`) are provided.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: integer
        Input value.

    Returns
    -------
    str: string
        Bit representation.

    Examples
    --------
    > var a = new {{alias:@stdlib/array/uint32}}( [ 1, 4, 9 ] );
    > var str = {{alias}}( a[ 0 ] )
    '00000000000000000000000000000001'
    > str = {{alias}}( a[ 1 ] )
    '00000000000000000000000000000100'
    > str = {{alias}}( a[ 2 ] )
    '00000000000000000000000000001001'
