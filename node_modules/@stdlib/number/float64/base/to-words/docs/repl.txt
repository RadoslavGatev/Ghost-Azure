{{alias}}( [out,] x )
    Splits a double-precision floating-point number into a higher order word
    (unsigned 32-bit integer) and a lower order word (unsigned 32-bit integer).

    When provided a destination object, the function returns an array with two
    elements: a higher order word and a lower order word, respectively. The
    lower order word contains the less significant bits, while the higher order
    word contains the more significant bits and includes the exponent and sign.

    Parameters
    ----------
    out: Array|TypedArray|Object (optional)
        Output array.

    x: number
        Double-precision floating-point number.

    Returns
    -------
    out: Array|TypedArray|Object
        Higher and lower order words.

    Examples
    --------
    > var w = {{alias}}( 3.14e201 )
    [ 1774486211, 2479577218 ]

    // Provide an output array:
    > var out = new {{alias:@stdlib/array/uint32}}( 2 );
    > w = {{alias}}( out, 3.14e201 )
    <Uint32Array>[ 1774486211, 2479577218 ]
    > var bool = ( w === out )
    true
