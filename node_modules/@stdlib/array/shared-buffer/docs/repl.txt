{{alias}}( size )
    Returns a shared array buffer having a specified number of bytes.

    A shared array buffer behaves similarly to a non-shared array buffer, except
    that a shared array buffer allows creating views of memory shared between
    threads.

    Buffer contents are initialized to 0.

    If an environment does not support shared array buffers, the function throws
    an error.

    Parameters
    ----------
    size: integer
        Number of bytes.

    Returns
    -------
    out: SharedArrayBuffer
        A shared array buffer.

    Examples
    --------
    // Assuming an environment supports SharedArrayBuffers...
    > var buf = new {{alias}}( 5 )
    <SharedArrayBuffer>


{{alias}}.length
    Number of input arguments the constructor accepts.

    Examples
    --------
    > {{alias}}.length
    1


{{alias}}.prototype.byteLength
    Read-only property which returns the length (in bytes) of the array buffer.

    Examples
    --------
    // Assuming an environment supports SharedArrayBuffers...
    > var buf = new {{alias}}( 5 );
    > buf.byteLength
    5


{{alias}}.prototype.slice( [start[, end]] )
    Copies the bytes of a shared array buffer to a new shared array buffer.

    Parameters
    ----------
    start: integer (optional)
        Index at which to start copying buffer contents (inclusive). If
        negative, the index is relative to the end of the buffer.

    end: integer (optional)
        Index at which to stop copying buffer contents (exclusive). If negative,
        the index is relative to the end of the buffer.

    Returns
    -------
    out: SharedArrayBuffer
        A new shared array buffer whose contents have been copied from the
        calling shared array buffer.

    Examples
    --------
    // Assuming an environment supports SharedArrayBuffers...
    > var b1 = new {{alias}}( 10 );
    > var b2 = b1.slice( 2, 6 );
    > var bool = ( b1 === b2 )
    false
    > b2.byteLength
    4
