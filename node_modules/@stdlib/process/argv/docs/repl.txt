{{alias}}
    An array containing command-line arguments passed when launching the calling
    process.

    The first element is the absolute pathname of the executable that started
    the calling process.

    The second element is the path of the executed file.

    Any additional elements are additional command-line arguments.

    In browser environments, the array is empty.
