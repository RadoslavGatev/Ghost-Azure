/**
* Applies a unary callback accepting a single-precision floating-point number and returning a signed 32-bit integer to a single-precision floating-point strided input array and assigns results to elements in a signed 32-bit integer strided output array.

* @param arrays   array whose first element is a pointer to a strided input array and whose last element is a pointer to a strided output array
* @param shape    array whose only element is the number of elements over which to iterate
* @param strides  array containing strides (in bytes) for each strided array
* @param fcn      callback
