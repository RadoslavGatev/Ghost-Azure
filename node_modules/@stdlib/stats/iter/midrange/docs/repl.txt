{{alias}}( iterator )
    Computes the mid-range of all iterated values.

    The mid-range is the arithmetic mean of maximum and minimum values.
    Accordingly, the mid-range is the midpoint of the range and a measure of
    central tendency.

    Parameters
    ----------
    iterator: Object
        Input iterator.

    Returns
    -------
    out: number|null
        Mid-range.

    Examples
    --------
    > var arr = {{alias:@stdlib/array/to-iterator}}( [ 1.0, -2.0, 3.0, -4.0 ] );
    > var v = {{alias}}( arr )
    -0.5
