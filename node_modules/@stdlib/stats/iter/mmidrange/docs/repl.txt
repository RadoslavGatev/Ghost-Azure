{{alias}}( iterator, W )
    Returns an iterator which iteratively computes a moving mid-range.

    The mid-range is the arithmetic mean of maximum and minimum values.
    Accordingly, the mid-range is the midpoint of the range and a measure of
    central tendency.

    The `W` parameter defines the number of iterated values over which to
    compute the moving mid-range.

    As `W` values are needed to fill the window buffer, the first `W-1` returned
    values are calculated from smaller sample sizes. Until the window is full,
    each returned value is calculated from all previously iterated values.

    If an environment supports Symbol.iterator, the returned iterator is
    iterable.

    Parameters
    ----------
    iterator: Object
        Input iterator.

    W: integer
        Window size.

    Returns
    -------
    iterator: Object
        Iterator.

    iterator.next(): Function
        Returns an iterator protocol-compliant object containing the next
        iterated value (if one exists) and a boolean flag indicating whether the
        iterator is finished.

    iterator.return( [value] ): Function
        Finishes an iterator and returns a provided value.

    Examples
    --------
    > var arr = {{alias:@stdlib/array/to-iterator}}( [ 2.0, -5.0, 3.0, 5.0 ] );
    > var it = {{alias}}( arr, 3 );
    > var v = it.next().value
    2.0
    > v = it.next().value
    -1.5
    > v = it.next().value
    -1.0
    > v = it.next().value
    0.0
