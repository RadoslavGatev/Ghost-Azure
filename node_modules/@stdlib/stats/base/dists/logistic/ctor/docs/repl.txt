{{alias}}( [μ, s] )
    Returns a logistic distribution object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    μ: number (optional)
        Location parameter. Default: `0.0`.

    s: number (optional)
        Scale parameter. Must be greater than `0`. Default: `1.0`.

    Returns
    -------
    logistic: Object
        Distribution instance.

    logistic.mu: number

        Read-only property which returns the differential entropy.

    logistic.kurtosis: number
        Read-only property which returns the excess kurtosis.

    logistic.mean: number
        Read-only property which returns the expected value.

    logistic.median: number
        Read-only property which returns the median.

    logistic.mode: number
        Read-only property which returns the mode.

    logistic.skewness: number
        Read-only property which returns the skewness.

    logistic.stdev: number
        Read-only property which returns the standard deviation.

    logistic.variance: number
        Read-only property which returns the variance.

    logistic.cdf: Function
        Evaluates the cumulative distribution function (CDF).

    logistic.logcdf: Function
        Evaluates the natural logarithm of the cumulative distribution function
        (CDF).

    logistic.logpdf: Function
        Evaluates the natural logarithm of the probability density function
        (PDF).

    logistic.mgf: Function
        Evaluates the moment-generating function (MGF).

    logistic.pdf: Function
        Evaluates the probability density function (PDF).

    logistic.quantile: Function
        Evaluates the quantile function at probability `p`.
