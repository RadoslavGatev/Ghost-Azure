{{alias}}( W )
    Returns an accumulator function which incrementally computes a moving
    product.

    The `W` parameter defines the number of values over which to compute the
    moving product.

    If provided a value, the accumulator function returns an updated moving
    product. If not provided a value, the accumulator function returns the
    current moving product.

    As `W` values are needed to fill the window buffer, the first `W-1` returned
    values are calculated from smaller sample sizes. Until the window is full,
    each returned value is calculated from all provided values.

    For accumulations over large windows or accumulations of large numbers, care
    should be taken to prevent overflow. Note, however, that overflow/underflow
    may be transient, as the accumulator does not use a double-precision
    floating-point number to store an accumulated product. Instead, the
    accumulator splits an accumulated product into a normalized fraction and
    exponent and updates each component separately. Doing so guards against a
    loss in precision.

    Parameters
    ----------
    W: integer
        Window size.

    Returns
    -------
    acc: Function
        Accumulator function.

    Examples
    --------
    > var accumulator = {{alias}}( 3 );
    > var p = accumulator()
    null
    > p = accumulator( 2.0 )
    2.0
    > p = accumulator( -5.0 )
    -10.0
    > p = accumulator( 3.0 )
    -30.0
    > p = accumulator( 5.0 )
    -75.0
    > p = accumulator()
    -75.0
