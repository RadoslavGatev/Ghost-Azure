# Probability Distributions Library for JavaScript
Functions for sampling random variables from probability distributions. Uses the same function names as R.

## Installation

`npm install --save probability-distributions`

`var PD = require("probability-distributions");`

## Documentation and examples
**See <a href="http://statisticsblog.com/probability-distributions/">http://statisticsblog.com/probability-distributions/</a>**


## Currently supported

- Binomial distribution

- Beta distribution

- Cauchy distribution

- Chi-Squared distribution

- Exponential distribution

- F distribution

- Gamma distribution

- Laplace distribution

- Log Normal distribution

- Negative Binomial distribution

- Normal (Gaussian) distribution

- Poisson distribution (not recommended for lambda > 100)

- Sample (shuffle an array, or select items using optional array of weights)

- Uniform distribution (with entropy option for standard uniform)

- Uniform limited to whole numbers

- Words (generate random words from a library of characters)
