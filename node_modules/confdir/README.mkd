# confdir
handle module specific configurations in their own directory

## Installation

`npm install confdir` or `npm install -g confdir`

## Usage

For example anywhere in a Git repository you could get a reference to the `.git`
directory:

``` js
var confdir = require('confdir');

confdir(__dirname, 'git', function (err, dir) {
  if (err)
    console.log(err);
  else
    console.log("The Git files are in " + dir);
});
```

This would print an absolute reference to the `.git` directory.

---

**confdir** is only one method:

`confdir(dir, name, callback)`

where

*   `dir` is a reference to a directory, that will be walked up,
*   `name` is the name of the configuration directory (without the dot) and
*   `callback` is a callback function that takes two arguments `(err, dir)`.
