### Breaking Changes
* You have to export `up` and `down` in your migration scripts. `down` is optional, but highly recommended, otherwise on failure your changes won't rollback completely.
* The `options` object which is passed into the migration script contains now by default a connection object. (`options.connection`). You have to explicit enable transactions, see README.
* A new migrations lock table get's added as soon as you run **any** command. You don't have to worry about that.
* Expect bug fixes in the upcoming days.

### Features

* Support full rollback (auto rollback on error)
* Shutdown hook
* Concurrency and locking
* A new shiny `rollback` command for manual rollback if needed.
