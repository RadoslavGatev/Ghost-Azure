# Ghost-Azure 

## Why Ghost-Azure?
Straight out of the box, the current versions of Ghost aren't compatible with Azure App Service. *Ghost-Azure* resolves this by providing a production-ready template that can be hosted directly on Azure App Service (on Windows). 

Note: This project hasn't introduced any changes to the original source code of Ghost. 

## Demo
[![Status of Demo deployment](https://vsrm.dev.azure.com/RG-GitHub/_apis/public/Release/badge/72c85fbd-8b34-4db0-8be1-f1a286cc4d59/3/4)](https://dev.azure.com/RG-GitHub/Ghost-Azure/_release?definitionId=3)

You can play with the demo web app: https://ghost-azure-demo.azurewebsites.net. Just give it some time to warm up. It runs on the Free plan of Azure App Service and most of the time stays unloaded from memory.
