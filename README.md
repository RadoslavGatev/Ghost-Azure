# Ghost-Azure 
## Why Ghost-Azure?
Straight out of the box, the current 1.x and 2.x versions of Ghost aren't compatible with the Azure App Service. Ghost-Azure resolves this by providing a production-ready template which can be hosted directly on Azure App Service. In the background, an Azure Function ([Ghost-Release-Uploader](https://github.com/RadoslavGatev/Ghost-Release-Uploader)) makes sure that this repository stays up-to-date with the latest releases of Ghost.

## Demo

You can play with the demo web app: https://ghost-azure-demo.azurewebsites.net. Just give it some time to warm up.
