## Acceptance Tests

This folder should only contain a set of basic API use cases.

The goal for acceptance tests is to keep test cases to basic usecases e.g. upload an image, schedule a post, download a theme. Otherwise tests should be written as a part of regression test suite.

Future improvement notes:
- We probably need a differentiation for the acceptance tests for session and api_key authentication.
